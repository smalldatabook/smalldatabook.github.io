# JSON - What's Next? - JSON for Humans


Use the `jasony` library (github: [`datatxt/jasony`](https://github.com/datatxt/jasony)) to 
read generation y / next generation json versions with comments, unquoted keys, multi-line strings, trailing commas, and more


## Usage - `HANSON.parse`

### HanSON

_HanSON - JSON for Humans by Tim Jansen et al_

HanSON is an extension of JSON  with a few simple additions to the spec:

- quotes for strings are optional if they follow JavaScript identifier rules.
- you can alternatively use backticks, as in ES6's template string literal, as quotes for strings.
  A backtick-quoted string may span several lines and you are not required to escape regular quote characters,
  only backticks. Backslashes still need to be escaped, and all other backslash-escape sequences work like in
  regular JSON.
- for single-line strings, single quotes (`''`) are supported in addition to double quotes (`""`)
- you can use JavaScript comments, both single line (`//`) and multi-line comments (`/* */`), in all places where JSON allows whitespace.
- Commas after the last list element or object property will be ignored.


Example:

``` js
{
  listName: "Sesame Street Monsters", // note that listName needs no quotes
  content: [
    {
      name: "Cookie Monster",
      /* Note the template quotes and unescaped regular quotes in the next string */
      background: `Cookie Monster used to be a
monster that ate everything, especially cookies.
These days he is forced to eat "healthy" food.`
    }, {
      // You can single-quote strings too:
      name: 'Herry Monster',
      background: `Herry Monster is a furry blue monster with a purple nose.
He's mostly retired today.`
    },    // don't worry, the trailing comma will be ignored
   ]
}
```

Use `HANSON.convert` to convert HanSON text to ye old' JSON text:

``` json
{
  "listName": "Sesame Street Monsters",       
  "content": [
    { "name": "Cookie Monster",
       "background": "Cookie Monster used to be a\n ... to eat \"healthy\" food."
    },
    { "name": "Herry Monster",
      "background": "Herry Monster is a furry blue monster with a purple nose.\n ... today."
    }
  ]
}
```

Use `HANSON.parse` instead of `JSON.parse` to parse text to ruby hash / array / etc.:

``` ruby
{
  "listName" => "Sesame Street Monsters",
  "content" => [
     { "name" => "Cookie Monster",
       "background" => "Cookie Monster used to be a\n ... to eat \"healthy\" food."
     },
     { "name" => "Herry Monster",
       "background" => "Herry Monster is a furry blue monster with a purple nose.\n ... today."
    }
  ]
}
```


**Live Example**


``` ruby
require 'jasony'

text =<<TXT
{
  listName: "Sesame Street Monsters", // note that listName needs no quotes
  content: [
    {
      name: "Cookie Monster",
      /* Note the template quotes and unescaped regular quotes in the next string */
      background: `Cookie Monster used to be a
monster that ate everything, especially cookies.
These days he is forced to eat "healthy" food.`
    }, {
      // You can single-quote strings too:
      name: 'Herry Monster',
      background: `Herry Monster is a furry blue monster with a purple nose.
He's mostly retired today.`
    },    // don't worry, the trailing comma will be ignored
   ]
}
TXT

pp HANSON.parse( text )  # note: is the same as JSON.parse( HANSON.convert( text ))
```

resulting in:

``` ruby
{
  "listName" => "Sesame Street Monsters",
  "content" => [
     { "name" => "Cookie Monster",
       "background" => "Cookie Monster used to be a\n ... to eat \"healthy\" food."
     },
     { "name" => "Herry Monster",
       "background" => "Herry Monster is a furry blue monster with a purple nose.\n ... today."
    }
  ]
}
```
